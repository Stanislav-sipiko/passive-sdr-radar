# Passive SDR Radar Project

Passive radar implementation using **KrakenSDR**.  
Pipeline: **IQ → CAF → MTI/CFAR → Clustering → Tracking**.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Passive radar works by using existing broadcast signals (like DVB-T) as illumination sources.  
We receive two streams:
- **Reference channel** – direct DVB-T signal from transmitter
- **Surveillance channel** – reflections from objects (planes, drones, rockets)

By computing the **Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF)** we detect moving objects, filter out static reflections, and track dynamic targets.
